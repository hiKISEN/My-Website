If we wanted to study climate change, we can find data on the *Combined Land-Surface Air and Sea-Surface Water Temperature Anomalies* in the Northern Hemisphere at [NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies](https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp). The [tabular data of temperature anomalies can be found here](https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/tabledata_v3/NH.Ts+dSST.txt)

To define temperature anomalies we need to have a reference, or base, period which NASA clearly states that it is the period between 1951-1980.

Run the code below to load the file:

```{r weather_data, cache=TRUE,warnings= FALSE, message=FALSE}

weather <- 
  read_csv("https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/tabledata_v3/NH.Ts+dSST.csv", 
           skip = 1, 
           na = "***")

```

Notice that, when using this function, we added two options: `skip` and `na`.

1. The `skip=1` option is there as the real data table only starts in Row 2, so we need to skip one row. 
1. `na = "***"` option informs R how missing observations in the spreadsheet are coded. When looking at the spreadsheet, we can see that missing data is coded as "***". It is best to specify this here, as otherwise some of the data is not recognized as numeric data.

For each month and year, the dataframe shows the deviation of temperature from the normal (expected). Further the dataframe is in wide format. 

we have two objectives in this section:

1. Select the year and the twelve month variables from the `weather` dataset. We do not need the others (J-D, D-N, DJF, etc.) for this assignment. Hint: use `select()` function.

1. Convert the dataframe from wide to 'long' format. Hint: use `gather()` or `pivot_longer()` function. Name the new dataframe as `tidyweather`, name the variable containing the name of the month as `month`, and the temperature deviation values as `delta`.


```{r tidyweather}

tidyweather <- weather %>% 
        select(Year:Dec) %>%
        pivot_longer(cols=2:13, names_to="Month", values_to="delta")

```

Inspect our dataframe. It should have three variables now, one each for 

1. year, 
1. month, and 
1. delta, or temperature deviation.

## Plotting Information

Let us plot the data using a time-series scatter plot, and add a trendline. To do that, we first need to create a new variable called `date` in order to ensure that the `delta` values are plot chronologically. 

```{r scatter_plot}

tidyweather <- tidyweather %>%
  mutate(date = ymd(paste(as.character(Year), Month, "1")),
         month = month(date, label=TRUE),
         year = year(date))

ggplot(tidyweather, aes(x=Year, y = delta))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(color="red") +
  theme_bw() +
  labs (
    title = "Increasing weather anomalies",
    subtitle = "Monthly temperature deviations over time",
    x = "Year",
    y = "Temperature deviation from expectation"
  )

```

Is the effect of increasing temperature more pronounced in some months? Use `facet_wrap()` to produce a seperate scatter plot for each month, again with a smoothing line. Our chart should human-readable labels; that is, each month should be labeled "Jan", "Feb", "Mar" (full or abbreviated month names are fine), not `1`, `2`, `3`. 

```{r facet_wrap}
ggplot(tidyweather, aes(x=Year, y = delta))+
  geom_point(size=1)+
  geom_smooth(color="red") +
  theme_bw() +
  facet_wrap(~month) +
  labs (title = "Weather Anomalies (Monthly focus)", subtitle = "Monthly temperature deviations over time",
    x = "Year",
    y = "Temperature deviation from expectation")


```

When investigating the produced plots, we find that the increase in temperature deviations from the normal (expected) temperature has increased significantly over the years in every month of the year. Investigating months we evidenced that that the delta has increased more significantly in the winter months than the summer months. Thus reporting clearly warmer winters than in the past.

It is sometimes useful to group data into different time periods to study historical data. For example, we often refer to decades such as 1970s, 1980s, 1990s etc. to refer to a period of time. NASA calcuialtes a temperature anomaly, as difference form the base periof of 1951-1980. The code below creates a new data frame called `comparison` that groups data in five time periods: 1881-1920, 1921-1950, 1951-1980, 1981-2010 and 2011-present. 

We remove data before 1800 and before using `filter`. Then, we use the `mutate` function to create a new variable `interval` which contains information on which period each observation belongs to. We can assign the different periods using `case_when()`.


```{r intervals}

comparison <- tidyweather %>% 
  filter(Year>= 1881) %>%     #remove years prior to 1881
  #create new variable 'interval', and assign values based on criteria below:
  mutate(interval = case_when(
    Year %in% c(1881:1920) ~ "1881-1920",
    Year %in% c(1921:1950) ~ "1921-1950",
    Year %in% c(1951:1980) ~ "1951-1980",
    Year %in% c(1981:2010) ~ "1981-2010",
    TRUE ~ "2011-present"
  ))

```

Inspect the `comparison` dataframe by clicking on it in the `Environment` pane.

Now that we have the `interval` variable, we can create a density plot to study the distribution of monthly deviations (`delta`), grouped by the different time periods we are interested in. Set `fill` to `interval` to group and colour the data by different time periods.

```{r density_plot}

ggplot(comparison, aes(x=delta, fill=interval))+
  geom_density(alpha=0.2) +   #density plot with tranparency set to 20%
  theme_bw() +                #theme
  labs (
    title = "Density Plot for Monthly Temperature Anomalies",
    y     = "Density", x = "Temperature deviation from expectation"        #changing y-axis label to sentence case
  )

```

So far, we have been working with monthly anomalies. However, we might be interested in average annual anomalies. We can do this by using `group_by()` and `summarise()`, followed by a scatter plot to display the result. 

```{r averaging,warnings= FALSE, message=FALSE}

#creating yearly averages
average_annual_anomaly <- tidyweather %>% 
  group_by(Year) %>%   #grouping data by Year
  
  # creating summaries for mean delta 
  # use `na.rm=TRUE` to eliminate NA (not available) values 
  summarise(annual_average_delta = mean(delta, na.rm=TRUE)) 

#plotting the data:
ggplot(average_annual_anomaly, aes(x=Year, y= annual_average_delta))+
  geom_point()+
  
  #Fit the best fit line, using LOESS method
  geom_smooth(method="loess") +
  
  #change to theme_bw() to have white background + black frame around plot
  theme_bw() +
  labs (
    title = "Average Yearly Anomaly",
      subtitle = "Average yearly temperature deviation from the normal",
    y     = "Average Annual Delta",
    x = "Year"
  )                         


```


## Confidence Interval for `delta`

[NASA points out on their website](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/world-of-change/decadaltemp.php) that 

> A one-degree global change is significant because it takes a vast amount of heat to warm all the oceans, atmosphere, and land by that much. In the past, a one- to two-degree drop was all it took to plunge the Earth into the Little Ice Age.

Let's construct a confidence interval for the average annual delta since 2011, both using a formula and using a bootstrap simulation with the `infer` package. Recall that the dataframe `comparison` has already grouped temperature anomalies according to time intervals; we are only interested in what is happening  between 2011-present.

```{r, calculate_CI_using_formula}

formula_ci <- comparison %>% 
            filter(interval=="2011-present")%>%
            summarize(mean_delta=mean(delta, na.rm=TRUE), 
                      SD_delta=sd(delta, na.rm=TRUE), 
                      count=n(), 
                      se_delta=SD_delta/sqrt(count), 
                      t_critical=qt(0.975,count-1), 
                      Lower_CI=mean_delta-t_critical*se_delta, upper_CI=mean_delta+t_critical*se_delta)

#print out formula_CI
formula_ci
```


```{r, calculate_CI_using_bootstrap,warnings= FALSE, message=FALSE}

library(infer)

bootstrap_delta <- comparison %>%
            filter(interval=="2011-present") %>%
            specify(response = delta) %>%
            generate(reps=1000, type="bootstrap") %>%
            calculate(stat = "mean") 

bootstrap_CI <- bootstrap_delta %>%
            get_ci(level=0.95, type = "percentile")

bootstrap_CI
```

The above calculated confidence intervals show us that a positive temperature deviation of approximately 1 degree Celcius is highly likely to occur, proving the overall hypothesis that our temperatures are increasing year by year. Suggesting a strong action to alt this process must be undertaken soon.
