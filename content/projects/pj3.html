<p>At the last board meeting of Omega Group Plc., the headquarters of a large multinational company, the issue was raised that women were being discriminated in the company, in the sense that the salaries were not the same for male and female executives. A quick analysis of a sample of 50 employees (of which 24 men and 26 women) revealed that the average salary for men was about 8,700 higher than for women. This seemed like a considerable difference, so it was decided that a further analysis of the company salaries was warranted.</p>
<p>The objective is to find out whether there is indeed a significant difference between the salaries of men and women, and whether the difference is due to discrimination or whether it is based on another, possibly valid, determining factor.</p>

<p>The results shows a significant difference in salary based on gender. Overall, based on these different indicators (mean, median, confidence intervals, etc.), female executives earn less than male co-workers. The mean difference is around 8696 (73239-64543), with a slightly higher deviation for female executives.</p>

<h2>Relationship Experience - Gender?</h2>
<p>At the board meeting, someone raised the issue that there was indeed a substantial difference between male and female salaries, but that this was attributable to other reasons such as differences in experience. A questionnaire send out to the 50 executives in the sample reveals that the average experience of the men is approximately 21 years, whereas the women only have about 7 years experience on average (see table below).</p>

These results question our first hypothesis.</p>

<h2>Relationship Salary - Experience ?</h2>
<p>Someone at the meeting argues that clearly, a more thorough analysis of the relationship between salary and experience is required before any conclusion can be drawn about whether there is any gender-based salary discrimination in the company.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ggplot(omega,aes(x=experience, y=salary))+

  geom_smooth()+
  labs(title=&quot;Relationship between salary and experience&quot;, x=&quot;Experience&quot;, y=&quot;Salary&quot;)</code></pre>

<p><img src="/projects/pj3_files/figure-html/salary_exp_scatter-2.png" width="648" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>The first graph shows that experience and salary are 2 correlated variables. However, the second graph show a clear difference in the level of salary between men and women for the same amount of experience.</p>

<div id="check-correlations-between-the-data" class="section level2">
<h2>Check correlations between the data</h2>
<pre class="r"><code>omega %&gt;% 
  select(gender, experience, salary) %&gt;% #order variables they will appear in ggpairs()

  theme_bw()</code></pre>
<p><img src="/projects/pj3_files/figure-html/ggpairs-1.png" width="648" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>The results show a difference between male and female executives in term of experience and salary, with a larger sample for women than men. Overall, women earn less for the same amount of experience compared to men. It also interesting to notice that the correlation between experience and salary is different for men and women. The correlation is higher for female, it indicates a higher predictive relationship between the 2 variables.</p>
